# How successful are the costal defences in Hunstanton?

## Introduction
This study looks at three research questions:
  1.  Do the coastal defences consistently protect the local tourist economy?
  2.	How effective are the coastal defences against geomorphic processes?
  3.	Do the local community feel that the coastal defences are socially sustainable?
  
The study of this question is very important to the stakeholders in Hunstanton. One of the purposes, I believe, is that it allows decision-makers like the Environmental Agency to evaluate how good the defences are at protecting not just the coastline but also the businesses situated along the coastline. On the 7th December 2013, Hunstanton Life published an article on the Storm Surge that destroyed the Sea Life Sanctuary. There was a promenade protecting the east coast, where the Sea Life was located, but the defences were submerged by the waves and did not protect the business when it needed to most. Geographical research benefits, not only the area that is question, in this case Hunstanton, but it also allows the knowledge that is acquired to be used in other areas such as the Holderness Coast.

## Study Area


## Expected Outcomes
When I go to Hunstanton, I expect to find that the sea defences that have been put in place are effective against geomorphic processes like erosion and longshore drift. For example, with the groynes, I would expect to see a build-up of sediment along the south side of the groynes. This is because Hunstanton mostly experiences south-westerly winds. The prevailing wind comes from this direction and the south side has the smallest drop due to the amount of sediment that has built up there. 

I would expect to find that the businesses that are along the coast front are protected by either the sea wall or the groynes. Also, I would expect that most local businesses are further inland to help prevent any important business from getting destroyed during storms. Most, if not all, the tourist businesses, I would expect to be along the coast to maximize the chance of boasting the economy and giving tourists the view of the beach and the sea that they came for. I think this because of places along the Holderness Coast like Hornsea which a coastal town as well. 

I wouldn’t expect the local community to find the coastal defences sustainable because of the storm surge and also due to the fact that the infamous Lighthouse is in danger of falling into the sea. This is going to deprive Hunstanton of some of it tourist income. Places along the East Anglia’s coastline have been disappearing into the sea along with the local community. The people of Hunstanton may fear that if something is not done to help then they may be in danger of being the next coastal city taking the plunge.
